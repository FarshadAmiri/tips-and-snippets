Problem: you want to change directory or copy a virtual environment:

1. Create a new venv in the desired directory

2. copy site-packages folder of the old venv to its place on new venv

3. now you don't have launchers in Scripts folder which you need 
them generally for Ipython and Jupyter. to install launchers:

3.1 activate new_venv then:

3.2 (new_venv) pip freeze > installed.txt
3.3 (new_venv) pip install --force-reinstall --no-deps --ignore-installed -r installed.txt

It will install all the launchers of all your packages with minimum download requirements.

(you may have to remove torch packages from that installed.txt to avoid errors.
No problem! you don't need torch launchers at all.)
