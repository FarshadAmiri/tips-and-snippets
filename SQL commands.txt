**************** UPDATE ******************
UPDATE flights SET duration = 28 WHERE origin IN ('Tehran', 'Mashahd') AND destination IN ('Mashhad','Tehran');

UPDATE student_tbl SET location = "dormitory" WHERE nationality IS NOT "Iranian";

*************** DELETE ************************
DELETE FROM flights WHERE destination = 'Tabriz';

DELETE FROM customers WHERE customerName = "Yasmine"

DELETE FROM flights;   #It deletes the whole table



******************WHERE Condition (Filtering)**************************
After WHERE we use a statement with a column and a value and an operator in between.
Operators are : Comparison operators ( = , != or <> , > , < , >= , <= , !> , !<) and 
Logical operators (BETWEEN , LIKE , IN , ALL , AND , ANY , EXISTS , NOT , OR , IS NULL , UNIQUE)

SELECT studentName, studentNumber from student_tbl WHERE faculty = "Engineering" ;

SELECT studentName, studentNumber from student_tbl WHERE faculty != "Engineering";

SELECT studentName, studentNumber from student_tbl WHERE aveMark >= 19;

SELECT studentName, studentNumber from student_tbl WHERE faculty IN "(Engineering" , "Science");

----------------------------
SELECT * from student_tbl WHERE [condition1] AND [condition2]...AND [conditionN]; 


SELECT studentName, studentNumber from student_tbl WHERE date_of_birth BETWEEN '2010-06-01' AND '2014-05-30';

SELECT * from student_tbl WHERE faculty LIKE 'Sc%';       # % represents 0,1 or Multiple characters

SELECT * from student_tbl WHERE faculty IN ('Engineering', 'Science');

SELECT *  FROM invoices  WHERE Total > 2 AND (BillingCountry = 'USA' OR BillingCountry = 'France'); 


Other Logical Operators Description:

ALL : Used to compare a single value to all the values in another value set.

AND: Allows for the existence of multiple conditions in an SQL statement's WHERE clause.

ANY: Used to compare a value to any applicable value in the list as per the condition.

BETWEEN: Used to search for values that are within a set of values, given the minimum value and the maximum value.

EXISTS: Used to search for the presence of a row in a specified table that meets a certain criterion.

IN: Used to compare a value to a list of literal values that have been specified.

LIKE: Used to compare a value to similar values using wildcard operators.

NOT: Reverses the meaning of the logical operator with which it is used. For example: NOT EXISTS, NOT BETWEEN, NOT IN, etc.â€¯This is a negate operator.

OR: Used to combine multiple conditions in an SQL statement's WHERE clause.

IS NULL: Used to compare a value with a NULL value.

UNIQUE: Searches every row of a specified table for uniqueness (no duplicates).



*************Operators (+ - / % BETWEEN LIKE IN) **************************
SELECT * FROM flights WHERE duration + stoppage_time <= 7;

SELECT * FROM employees WHERE salary / hours <=20;

SELECT allowance / salary * 100 FROM employee; 

SELECT * FROM employees WHERE hours % 2 = 0;     # % : remainder

SELECT salary + 500 FROM employees:

SELECT * FROM flights WHERE origin LIKE '%a%';


************** Other Clauses *************
* LIMIT   *ORDER BY     *GROUP BY    *HAVING   *DISTINCT

SELECT * FROM flights ORDER BY duration DESC;     #default Order mode is Ascending (ASC)

SELECT * FROM flights ORDER BY duration DESC, stops ASC;       

SELECT * FROM flights ORDER BY duration LIMIT 10;           #Shows you Top 10 based on duration



SELECT * FROM flights GROUP BY origin;      #It shows just uique origins...

SELECT * FROM flights GROUP BY origin HAVING 3;      #HAVING works with GROUP BY 


SELECT DISTINCT country FROM customers;

SELECT DISTINCT faculty, country FROM student_tbl;


*********************CONSTRAINT & Keys ******************************
CONSTRAINTs are NOT NULL, UNIQUE, PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY, CHECK, DEFAULT, CREATE INDEX

CREATE TABLE table_order( 
    order_id INT, 
    date_time DATETIME, 
    table_id INT, 
    waiter_id INT, 
    PRIMARY KEY (order_id), 
    FOREIGN KEY (table_id) REFERENCES tbl(table_id), 
    FOREIGN KEY (waiter_id) REFERENCES waiter(waiter_id));



CREATE TABLE Persons (
    ID int NOT NULL,
    LastName varchar(255) NOT NULL,
    FirstName varchar(255),
    Age int,
    City varchar(255) DEFAULT 'Sandnes'
);


CREATE TABLE Orders (
    ID int NOT NULL,
    OrderNumber int NOT NULL,
    OrderDate date DEFAULT GETDATE()
);


CREATE TABLE Persons (
    ID int NOT NULL,
    LastName varchar(255) NOT NULL,
    FirstName varchar(255),
    Age int,
    CHECK (Age>=18)
);

#To allow naming of a CHECK constraint, and for defining a CHECK constraint on multiple columns, use the following SQL syntax:

CREATE TABLE Persons (
    ID int NOT NULL,
    LastName varchar(255) NOT NULL,
    FirstName varchar(255),
    Age int,
    City varchar(255),
    CONSTRAINT CHK_Person CHECK (Age>=18 AND City='Sandnes')
);

CREATE TABLE Orders (
    OrderID int NOT NULL,
    OrderNumber int NOT NULL,
    PersonID int,
    PRIMARY KEY (OrderID),
    FOREIGN KEY (PersonID) REFERENCES Persons(PersonID)
);

ALTER TABLE Orders
DROP FOREIGN KEY FK_PersonOrder;

#To allow naming of a PRIMARY KEY constraint, and for defining a PRIMARY KEY constraint on multiple columns, use the following SQL syntax:

CREATE TABLE Persons (
    ID int NOT NULL,
    LastName varchar(255) NOT NULL,
    FirstName varchar(255),
    Age int,
    CONSTRAINT PK_Person PRIMARY KEY (ID,LastName)
);


****************** JOIN ************************
SELECT last_name, origin, destination FROM fleights JOIN passengers ON fleights.id = passengers.fleight_id;
# JOIN is equal to INNER JOIN (INNER JOIN is the sqlite preferred name) - Doesn't matter which one to use.
