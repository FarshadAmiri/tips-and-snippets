This command builds and starts all the services defined in your docker-compose.yml file.
The --build flag indicates that Docker Compose should build any images that have changed
since the last build. If the images are already built, it will reuse the existing ones.
* The -d flag stands for "detached" mode, which means the containers will run in the
background. This allows you to continue using your terminal without being attached to the
container logs.
---------------------------------------

---------------------------------------
docker-compose up (on the directory that contains docker-compose.yml file)




This command stops and removes the containers, networks, and volumes created by Docker Compose.
It effectively shuts down the services defined in your docker-compose.yml file. This command is
useful when you want to clean up your environment or stop the services temporarily.
